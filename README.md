# IoT Buttons Project

I have set up a Raspberry Pi Zero W to detect button presses and send a request to IFTTT which then sends a notification via Pushbullet to phones/computers/etc. saying that a button has been pressed (and which button it was).

It works although is a little tempermental.
Here's a video of it working https://youtu.be/wZvDlqBUsmE
